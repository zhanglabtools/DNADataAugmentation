# DNADataAugmentation
Source code for paper 'Simple tricks of convolutional neural network architectures improve DNAâ€“protein binding prediction'. 
Some reusable code is sort out for further use. In addition, some numerical results are also uploaded to the 'Result' folder for reproduction results.
